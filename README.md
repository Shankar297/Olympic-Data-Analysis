The Olympic Games is an important international event featuring summer and winter sports. Summer Olympic Games and Winter Olympic Games are held every four years. Originally, the ancient Olympic Games were held in Ancient Greece at Olympia. Olympic games started 1896. We have to do analysis on this Olympic data, afterthat building a web app using python and streamlit and deploy on Heroku

## Approach
Data Exploration : Exploring dataset using pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.

Data visualization : Ploted interactive graphs using plotly.

Building web app : Building web app using python.

User Interface & deployment :  Created an UI that shows the output.
                          After that I have deployed project on heroku.
## Technologies Used
 
   1. Python 
   2. Pandas
   3. Numpy
   4. Matplotlib
   5. Seaborn
   6. Steamlit
   7. plotly

## Deployement on Heroku
Create a virtual app on Heroku website. You can either connect your github profile or download cli to manually deploy this project.
Follow the instruction given on [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) to deploy a web app.

## Bugs & Logs

1. If you find a bug, kindly open an issue and it will be addressed as early as possible.
2. Under localhost, logging is performed for all the actions and its stored onto logs.txt file
3. When the app is deployed on heroku, logs can be viewed on  heroku dashboard or CLI.
